# Blog Generator:

Below are the procedures on how to use the blog-generator to create a new blog

## Generating JSON file for Blog Content
Generate the json file to put the blog contents. Run new-blog.py and add the url to your new blog.
```
> python new-blog.py new-blog
```

This creates the file **new-blog.json**

## Inside the JSON file and Filling in the Details
The generated json file will look as follows:
```json
    {
        "url": "new-blog",
        "blog_image": "",
        "tags" : [],
        "title" : "",
        "body" : []    
    }
```
| json key | what to put | example |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `url` | this is automatically generated | |
| `blog_image`| a file name that exists in the blogs/images folder **NOTE:** only one image can be added to every blog post | _"new_blog_image.jpg"_
| `tags` | a list of tags for the blog post | _["android", "music", "travel"]_ |
| `title` | The title of the blog post | _"New Blog"_ |
| `body` | The main content of the blog. Each paragraph should be a separate element in the list | _["This is paragraph 1", "This is paragraph2"]_ 

## Creating the static blog page

Once filling in the json is completed, the next step is to generate the html file for the blog page. To do so, run add-blog.py and add the same url to your blog. 
```
> python add-blog.py new-blog
```

The url to the new blog post will now be **"http://example.com/blogs/\<new-blog>"**
