I have recently updated my entire website once again. Now that school's over and now that I have a bit more time to do things on my computer, I decided that I'd give my website a bit of \"re-design\". The first thing that I want to research more would be how to improve the blogging system without the use of database and solely relying on GitHub pages to take advantage of the free hosting capability. The other thing I want to work on when I do web dev is to be able to lessen the hard coded contents on my page and improve on how I render them on pages. It doesn't seem like a lot of work right now, and I might just be blabbering right now trying to write my first blog content at 1:30 in the morning. But hopefully here's a start to posting more blog contents on my site.", "Aside from just everything that has to do with computers, I hope to also post some of my activities on the daily including my travels, and other adventures.", "I'll leave things here for now. I'll post more soon!"]}]}
