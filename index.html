                    <h3>MOBILE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                    <p>Android dev is currently my favourite. Since the first time I built an ANdroid app for one of my courses, I knew I wanted to o more. I really have gotten the hang of working with Android Studio. I have already developed some of my future goals in mobile dev: first would be to explore creating a library in Android to easily render views that will be most likely based on Material Design standards.</p><p>At some point, I would also to expand my mobile development knowledge by exploring Swift and learning to built iOS applications. I would also like to dive in to building native apps with React Native.</p>

                    <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                    <p>My first ever dev experience was creating a simple website with HTTP and CSS. I then started using different frameworks such as Jquery and Bootstrap. I enjoy playing around and creating a website from scratch and designing the look of the website.</p>
                    <p>I also enjoy creating the backend services for sites. I have experience working with ASP.NET and was able to get a summer internship dealing with web apps, and I also experienced dealing with databases for the web.</p>

As president, I was able to take part in organizing our yearly hackathons. In my time as president I was also able to improve our branding (online presence, merchandise) as well as change the organization structure for better communication and transitioning. </li>
                        <li><strong>Computer Engineering Club - VP Social: </strong>I was incharge of any academic and social events of the club. Some of these events include: Meet A Computer Engineer - Panel night with experienced industry representatives, and also Trick or Treat - in collaboration with other discipline association in engineering</li>
                        <li><strong>U of A - Orientation Leader (2014; 2015)</strong>: A whole 2-day event where I introduced Frehmen Engineers to the facilities and serices on campus.</li>
